# MOVIE SEARCH APP

Today I'll be building an app for searching for hot movies. I will be using a public API and building a simple and easy to navigate frontend for the app.

The core code for my app structure is found in the `index.html` file. Styling of the app is achieved by css rules I have written in `styles.css` file.

The `src/index.js` file hosts the code for manipulating the app's features after the DOM has loaded. 

The API url I am fetching data from is [https://imdb-api.com/en/API/SearchMovie/k_6rxyo4au/inception%202010]
